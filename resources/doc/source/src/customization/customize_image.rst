The `image/` directory contains the following assets that can be customized:

- **favicon.ico**: The browser icon for the application.
- **logo.svg**: The main logo displayed in the application at the top right corner in the sticky header.
- **train-animation.svg**: A vector animation that is displayed before loading the map.

Ensure that replacement images follow the same format and dimensions for proper display.
