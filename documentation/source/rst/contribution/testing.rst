Testing is managed using an XML-based history system located in the `quality` folder.

Comprehensive documentation for the testing framework is planned for the future. Currently, testing is tracked through the following XML files:

Test Dimensions
---------------
**File:** `test-dimension.xml`

This file specifies different testing dimensions that can be applied to test cases, such as performance, reliability, or security aspects.

Test Campaigns

**File:** `test.xml`

This file records actual test campaign executions, documenting test runs and results.
